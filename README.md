Vehicle failure analysis using data studio.
I used vehicle failure data which as

 *  US states
 *  vehicle number
 *  labour cost
 *  labour hour
 *  failure at mileage
 *  failure month and
 *  material cost.


We have data for vehicles failures each states in US

#### Geo location Chart
So I used to represent the states with geo location

for Example:
     If i click texas place in geo location,it shows the texas data 
     
#### Scatter chart
With scatter chart,represented avaerage labour cost and labour hours.
  
For Example:
     If labour hour is increase ,then labour cost also will increase.

#### Gauge chart
With Gauge chart,we can see labour cost 

for example:
     If i click newyork,we can see labour cost 
 
#### first Line chart
with line chart ,we can know the material cost and labour cost.

#### Second line chart
So if we want to know the failure at mileage,vechile number,failure month in particular state...
* How many vechicles are at failure in this month
* How many vechicles are at mileage failure with vehicle
